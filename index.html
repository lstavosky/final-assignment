      When I first signed up for Web Design, I thought the class was going to be about creating websites and making online art. I never would have thought that the class would be focused on coding. When I read the course description, I think it talked about how we would do visual art on a computer. This led me to think the course was going to be focused on these aspects. But on the first day, I learned that the course would mostly focus on coding. When selecting a course to take for my art credit, I thought Web Design would be a good class. The name Web Design made me think of creating brochures, posters, and infographics. When reading the course name, it did not make me think of coding websites. I would have not picked this course, for example, if the name was “Coding 101” or something like it. Even though the course was not what I expected, in the end, it is a very fun and enjoyable class.
