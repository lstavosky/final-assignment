    <p>
      When I first started the course I had no coding skills. The only skills I had that were computer-related was using the computer. I knew and still know how to use a computer well. I also played/ still play a lot of single-player games Minecraft. Before I took the course I had not previously used coding or know what it is. The level of knowledge that I knew is that someone made the game/ website. I did not know how they did it or how I could do it as well.
