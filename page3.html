    <p>
      Since I have taken this class for 4 intersessions I have gained a lot of knowledge. I have learned how to code and build websites. Since I did not know code before this class I have gained this new skill. After taking this class I have become more comfortable doing code. In the beginning, I really did not want to do it since I was new to the subject. After taking the course I have found a love for coding and now try to do each assignment to the fullest.
